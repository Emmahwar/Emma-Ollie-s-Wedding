  <h1>Emma & Ollie's Wedding</h1>

  <p>We're getting married on <strong>Friday 23rd August 2025</strong> and we’d love a few of our closest people to be there with us. We're keeping it simple, intimate and full of meaning. Nothing extravagant, just real moments with those who matter most. No big bash, but a beautiful and memorable day nonetheless.</p>

  <h2>Ceremony Details</h2>
  <p><strong>Time:</strong> 9:30 AM</p>
  <p><strong>Location:</strong> <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NZ5pLqYXQgwBD81t5" target="_blank">The Guildhall, High Street, Bath, BA1 5AW</a></p>
  <p>The ceremony will be short and heartfelt. If you’d like to witness us make it official, we’d love to have you there. Please RSVP below so we know to expect you. Feel free to come just for the ceremony — there's absolutely no pressure to stay longer if you're tight on time or juggling little ones.</p>
  <p><em>To help us keep the space calm and personal for Sabrina and everyone attending, we kindly ask that no children over the age of 2 join us. We hope you understand and know this decision comes with care.</em></p>

  <h2>Join Us for Lunch?</h2>
  <p>After the ceremony, we’ll be heading to Browns in Bath for a relaxed meal. There won’t be a reception or party — just a good lunch, some nice company, and a toast or two. If you'd like to come, we ask that guests kindly pay for their meal instead of giving a gift. With Sabrina in our lives and everything settling down, that feels right for us and keeps things simple and stress-free.</p>
  <p>The set menu is lovely and caters for most dietary needs — please let us know anything specific in your RSVP.</p>
